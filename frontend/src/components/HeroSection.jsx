            Pain management is often approached by general physicians, orthopaedicians, neurologists,
            oncologists, and anaesthesiologists. However, the growing burden of chronic and cancer-related
            pain calls for dedicated expertise and interdisciplinary care. <strong>Dr. Gaurav Chanana</strong>, Associate Director
            in Pain and Palliative Medicine at Max Super Speciality Hospital, brings over a decade of specialized
            experience in pain relief, interventional pain procedures, and palliative care.
            <br /><br />
            Trained at premier institutions including <strong>AIIMS</strong> and certified in both pain medicine and palliative care,
            Dr. Chanana has been instrumental in establishing integrative palliative services in the oncology
            departments of leading hospitals in Delhi-NCR. His work emphasizes evidence-based interventions
            tailored to individual needsâ€”especially for patients living with cancer, advanced illness, or persistent pain.
            Together with the team, he offers comprehensive care that not only alleviates suffering but also enhances
            quality of lifeâ€”a much-needed shift in India's evolving healthcareÂ landscape.
