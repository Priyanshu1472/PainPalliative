  cancer: [
    {
      "id": "c1",
      "question": "What causes cancer pain?",

    },
    {
      "id": "c2",
      "question": "How to rate your pain?",
      "answer": "Pain is rated using a 0â€“10 scale, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain. Patients are asked to describe their pain type (e.g., sharp, throbbing), location, and when it hurts. This helps in developing a personalized pain management plan.",
      "category": "cancer"
    },
    {
      "id": "c3",

      "category": "cancer"
    },
    {
      "id": "c6",
      "question": "What minimally invasive procedures may be suggested to relieve cancer pain?",

      "category": "cancer"
    },
    {
      "id": "c7",
      "question": "How long will I get pain relief from a dose of the medication you are recommending?",

      "category": "cancer"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "id": "o2",
      "question": "Will I become addicted to morphine (or other strong pain medicines)?",
      "answer": "No, these medicines do not cause addiction if taken as instructed by the doctor and under supervision of the pain specialist doctor.",
      "category": "opioids"
    },
    {
      "id": "o3",
      "question": "If morphine is taken for pain now, will it become ineffective later when the pain gets worse?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Morphine will continue to be effective throughout the pain course.",

    {
      "id": "o8",
